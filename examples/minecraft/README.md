# Lazy Load Docker Minecraft Server
## Startup
```
git clone https://github.com/vmorganp/Lazytainer
cd Lazytainer/examples/minecraft
docker-compose up 
```

## Watch the magic happen
After a configurable period of no activity the server should stop  
if you generate some traffic by trying to connect to the instance or running a command like

`telnet localhost 25565`

 a few times

 you should see the minecraft container automatically restart itself
