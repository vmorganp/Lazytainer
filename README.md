## Quick Explanation

Monitors network traffic to containers. If there is traffic, the container runs, otherwise the container is stopped/paused. for more details check out the [Configuration](##Configuration) section.

## Want to test it?

1. Clone the project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vmorganp/Lazytainer
   cd Lazytainer
   ```
2. Start the stack
   ```sh
   # if "docker compose" doesn't work, try "docker-compose"
   docker compose up
   ```
   This will create 2 containers that you can reach through a third "lazytainer" container
3. View the running container by navigating to its web ui at `http://localhost:81`. You should see some information about the container
4. Close the tab and wait until the logs say "stopped container"
5. Navigate again to `http://localhost:81`, it should be a dead page
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:81` several times, enough to generate some network traffic, and it should start
7. To clean up, run
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Configuration

### Note:

Lazytainer does not "automatically" start and stop all of your containers. You must apply a label to them and proxy their traffic through the Lazytainer container.

### Examples

For examples of lazytainer in action, check out the [Examples](./examples/)

### Groups

Lazytainer starts and stops other containers in "groups" of one or more other containers. To assign a container to a lazytainer group, a label must be added. The label will look like this.

```yaml
yourContainerThatWillSleep:
  # ... configuration omitted for brevity
  labels:
    - "lazytainer.group=<yourGroupName>"
```

To configure a group, add labels to the lazytainer container like this. Note that each is required to have a port(s) specified. These ports must also be forwarded on the lazytainer container

```yaml
lazytainer:
  # ... configuration omitted for brevity
  ports:
    - 81:81 # used by group1 and group2
    - 82:82 # used by group2
  labels:
    # Configuration items are formatted like this
    - "lazytainer.group.<yourGroupName>.<property>=value"
    # configuration for group 1
    - "lazytainer.group.group1.ports=81"
    # configuration for group 2
    - "lazytainer.group.group2.ports=81,82"
```

Group properties that can be changed include:

| Name                | description                                                                                                                                                                                        | required | default |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| ports               | Network ports associated with a group, can be comma separated. Should be the INTERNAL port, not the EXPOSED port. ex: service running on `8080` but exposed on `80` should have port set to `8080` | Yes      | n/a     |
| inactiveTimeout     | Time (seconds) before container is stopped when there is insufficient network activity                                                                                                             | No       | 30      |
| minPacketThreshold  | Minimum count of network packets for container to be on                                                                                                                                            | No       | 30      |
| ignoreActiveClients | Determine container activity based on only packet count, ignoring connected client count.                                                                                                          | No       | false   |
| pollRate            | How frequently (seconds) to check network activity                                                                                                                                                 | No       | 30      |
| sleepMethod         | How to put the container to sleep. Can be `stop` or `pause`                                                                                                                                        | No       | `stop`  |
| netInterface        | Network interface to listen on                                                                                                                                                                     | No       | `eth0`  |

### Additional Configuration

#### Verbose Logging

If you would like more verbose logging, you can apply the environment variable `VERBOSE=true` to lazytainer like so

```yaml
lazytainer:
  # ... configuration omitted for brevity
  environment:
    - VERBOSE=true
```

#### Volumes

If using lazytainer, you MUST provide the following volume to lazytainer

```yaml
lazytainer:
  # ... configuration omitted for brevity
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
```
